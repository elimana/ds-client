DSClient is a client-Side simulator for the Distributed System Simulator 'ds-sim'.

To compile the program, run the *makefile.sh* script and class files will be generated in the *compiled* folder.

To run the program, use the command `java DSClient.class`, optionally with the argument `-g` to force the program to use 'GETS All' to retrieve the server information instead of parsing the *ds-system.xml* file.
